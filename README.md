## CUL Email Notification Configuration

Configure values for Sword Deposit notification sender and recipient by adding a cul_sword block and providing values for the following two variables:

[cul_sword]

recipient_email = ""

sender_email = "" 

In addition, CUL notification specifications require modifications to the data in two OJS database tables.

In the email_templates_default table, for the record with email_key "SWORD_DEPOSIT_NOTIFICATION", set can_edit to 0.

In the email_templates_default_data table, for the record with email_key "SWORD_DEPOSIT_NOTIFICATION", we provide the following values:

subject:
OJS Sword Deposit Notification

body:
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ID: {$ID}</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Directory Name: {$directoryName}</span></p>
